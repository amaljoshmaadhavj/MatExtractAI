      "text": "Mechanical Testing of Thin Sheet Magnesium Alloys\nin Biaxial Tension and Uniaxial Compression\nD. Steglich & X. Tian & J. Bohlen & T. Kuwabara\nReceived: 25 November 2013 /Accepted: 14 April 2014 /Published online: 7 May 2014\n# Society for Experimental Mechanics 2014\nAbstract Tension and compression experiments on mag-\nnesium rolled sheets and extruded products of AZ31\n(Mg+3%Al+1%Zn) and ZE10 (Mg+1%Zn+0.3%Ce\nbased misc metal) were performed at room temperature.\nThe tests were conducted along the longitudinal and the\ntransverse direction to quantify the in-plane anisotropy.\nSamples built from adhesively-bonded layers of sheets\nwere used for in-plane as well as through-thickness com-\npression testing. It was verified that this simple testing\nmethod leads to identical results as using comb-like dies\nand equi-biaxial bulge testing, respectively. In the case of\nuniaxial loading, the longitudinal and transverse strain\ncomponents were measured using independent extensome-\nters. R-values were calculated from these signals. The\nmechanical responses were correlated to the microstructure\nand the texture. The recorded differences between tensile\nand compressive response reveal the strength differential\neffect of the materials. The distortional character of the\nplastic behaviour is evidenced through their responses to\nequi-biaxial tensile loading. Significant differences in the\ncompressive responses of the two alloys were identified by\ncomparing the respective hardening rates.\nKeywords Strength differential effect . Differential\nhardening . Anisotropy . Sheet metal . Magnesium alloy\nIntroduction\nMotivated by the growing demand for lightweight materials,\nresearch on magnesium and its alloys has been getting more\nattention as magnesium is the lightest metal in use for the\nproduction of structural components in the automotive and\naircraft industry. Despite the high strength-to-weight ratio, the\napplication of wrought magnesium (i.e. sheets and extruded\nprofiles) to lightweight structures is restricted due to its pro-\nnounced anisotropy, the tension-compression asymmetry (the\nso-called strength differential effect, SD effect) [20, 21] as\nwell as its comparably poor formability, especially at room\ntemperature [20, 14]. Existing applications are mainly based\non cast products. The use of sheets for the fabrication of\ncomponents and structures can still be expanded in an attempt\nto use the full light-weight potential of metallic magnesium.\nThe reason for the specific mechanical behaviour lies in\nthe hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattice structure which\nrestricts the number of deformation mechanisms in com-\nparison to cubic metals. Therefore the ductility as well as\nthe formability of magnesium sheets is limited, which\npartly confines the whole process chain, i.e. the rolling\nprocedures for magnesium sheets, the forming procedures\nof structural components and subsequently the mechanical\nproperties of the resulting parts. The application of\nwrought magnesium alloys requires reliable simulation\ntools for predicting the forming capabilities, the structural\nresponse to mechanical loads and the lifetime of the compo-\nnent. The respective constitutive models have to account for\nthe mentioned peculiarities of the mechanical behaviour,\ndemanding for sophisticated simulation techniques.\nD. Steglich (*): X.

      "text": "The distinct role that easily activated basal slip plays in strain\naccommodation during deformation has been pointed out to\ncorrelate the anisotropic flow behaviour to the texture of the\nmaterial. It has been shown that even slight differences in the\nangular distribution of basal planes can explain visible differ-\nences in the yield stresses, e.g. as a function of the orientation of\nsheets [1]. Furthermore, the micromechanical source of the SD\neffect as well as of (planar) anisotropy was investigated by many\nresearchers in the past [2, 3, 22, 24, 25, 44]. It is confirmed that\nmechanical {10–12} twinning is easily activated and can give a\nmajor contribution to deformation in case of c-axis extension,\nbut it does not so in case of c-axis compression [36, 15]. Thus,\nthe statistical distribution of the c-axis orientation of a magne-\nsium alloy, the initial texture, primarily determines its plastic\ndeformation behavior. While in case of a random or weak\ntexture, e.g. in case of die-cast alloy, no significant difference\nin the mechanical behavior between tension and compression is\nobserved [18], textured alloys experience different yielding in\ntension and compression. The latter was frequently confirmed\nfor extruded magnesium products of different alloys, e.g. [42,\n47, 8, 10]. The plastic behaviour during compression was\nmostly investigated with respect to load reversals and less often\nfor rolled sheets compared to extrudates. Contributions to the\nquantification of sheet material under compression field can be\nfound, see e.g. [29, 30, 26]. The reason for this underrepresen-\ntation of respective test results might be the challenges arising\nfrom bucking of the sheet sample once compressive stresses are\napplied. Limitations either for the sheet’s width-to-thickness-\nratio or the achieved maximum strain apply [12]. To overcome\nthis, methods were developed to stabilize the compressed sheet\nby applying a transverse force via a die, see [28] or by a fixture\nin an universal tester [12]. Alternatively, buckling can be\nprevented by stacking stacked test pieces [40], or by a combi-\nnation of adhesively bonded sheet laminate specimens and a\nclamping device [45]. Maeda et al. [31] showed that the effect of\nfriction and the misalignment of the compression platens can be\ncontrolled and therefore compression of stacked and glued\ncubes of sheet material can be used to derive valid stress-strain\ndata. Very recently, this method was successfully applied to the\nmagnesium alloy AZ31B-O, see [17].\nStrain hardening differs significantly between tension and\ncompression in case of textured magnesium samples. While\nthe stress-strain relationship in uniaxial tension typically is a\nconvex curve, a sigmoidal function results from compression\n[11]. Four subsequent stages of the hardening behaviour are\nidentified, namely (I) that of the elastic–plastic transition; (II)\nthe range of low or conventional rate of strain hardening; (III)\nthe range where the rate of hardening increases and (IV) the\nrange of decreasing work hardening [23]. These differences in\nhardening evolution between tension and compression load-\ning should be considered in constitutive models addressing\nforming operations [39], for spring back prediction [29] and\nfor the assessment of crashworthiness.\nIn this paper the plastic deformation of two different\nwrought magnesium alloys (AZ31 and ZE10) under quasi-\nstatic tensile and compressive loading conditions at room\ntemperature is studied. It aims at providing the necessary input\nfor modeling the plastic response of planar anisotropic or\northotropic poly crystals. A relatively simple method for de-\ntermining the compressive stress-strain curve using layered\nsheets is applied. The generated results are compared to the\ndata recorded from an established method of compression\ntesting [28]. Beside the tensile and compression tests along\nthe axes of orthotropy, results of through-thickness compres-\nsion tests using layered sheets are presented here. The equi-\nbiaxial stress-strain curve obtained by this method is discussed\nin the light of previously generated results [37].\nMaterials and Microstructures\nTwo different commercial magnesium rolled sheets were se-\nlected for investigation: A well-known and widely used\nwrought magnesium alloy AZ31 (Mg+3 %Al+1 %Zn) and\nan alloy, ZE10 (Mg+1 %Zn+0.3 %Ce based misc metal) with\nimproved formability. The differences in the mechanical be-\nhavior and the formability of the two magnesium sheet alloys\nhave been described in earlier works, see [14, 44, 33]. ZE10\nshows improved ductility at room temperature compared to\nAZ31 which is associated with an effect of the included rare\nearth elements in ZE10 and the result of deformation and\nrecrystallization during sheet rolling.\nThe two alloys are used in form of magnesium sheets in an\nannealed condition (O-temper) with a thickness of 2 mm. Both\nsheets were received from the former Salzgitter Magnesium\nTechnology SZMT of Germany. In Fig. 1 micrographs and pole\nfigures of the two rolled sheets are presented. The sheets reveal a\nfully recrystallized microstructure resulting in a comparable av-\nerage grain size of 15 μm. More in detail, the grains of the AZ31-\nsheet appear equi-axed with a broad size distribution whereas in\nZE10 a preferential alignment with a longer axis in RD is found.\nThis underlines a delay of recrystallization during rolling and/or\nannealing of this alloy. These differences in the grain structure\nare unlikely to cause significant variations of the mechanical\nbehavior. The texture is shown in the form of re-calculated\n(0002) basal pole and {10–10} prismatic pole figures. These\npole figures are based on x-ray measurements of six incomplete\npole figures in a Panalytical X’Pert Pro x-ray diffractometer with\na goniometer setup. An open source code MTEX [7] has been\napplied to calculate the orientation distribution function and re-\ncalculate full pole figures. The AZ31 sheet has a strong basal\ntexture with a preferential alignment of basal planes in the sheet\nplane. It is noted that the intensity distribution of the basal pole is\nbroader between ND and RD rather than between ND and TD,\ntypical of rolled AZ31 alloys. The ZE10 sheet exhibits a signif-\nicantly weaker texture which does not show the basal character\n1248\nExp Mech (2014) 54:1247–1258"

There is no preferential alignment of basal\nplanes in the sheet plane (i.e. with the c-axis close to ND) but a\nweak component with a tilt to the TD.\nIn an approach to compare the resulting microstructures and\nproperties of different conditions of the two alloys an extruded\ncomponent was used for comparison. Gravity cast slabs of AZ31\nand ZE10 were homogenization annealed for 15 h at 350 °C and\nextruded at 300 °C to hollow rectangular profiles that consist of\nfour plane rectangular cross sections with a thickness of 1.7 mm.\nIt is noted that the processing route was different compared to the\nrolled sheets but sheet-like sections were obtained and used for\nanalysis in the same way. Figure 2 shows micrographs and pole\nfigures of the extruded alloys. Typical extruded microstructures\nare revealed with an almost fully recrystallized grain structure\nwhich still allows the extrusion direction to be seen because of a\npreferential elongation of grains. Different average grain sizes\ncorrespond to a broader size distribution of grains. AZ31 reveals\nan average grain size of 11 μm whereas ZE10 shows a slightly\ncoarser microstructure with an average grain size of 15 μm. In\nboth cases the texture can be characterized by a strong basal\ncomponent which is principally comparable to that of the AZ31\nsheet in Fig. 1. However, the orientation of broader angular\ndistribution is different and is broader between the ND and the\nTD in the extrudates.\nExperimental Setup\nTension Tests\nTo characterize the mechanical behavior of the magnesium\nsheets, quasi-static uniaxial tensile tests were conducted with a\nconstant nominal strain rate of 0.001/s at room temperature. A\nuniversal testing setup Zwick Z050 was used. The tension\ntests were performed using flat dog bone-shaped specimens\nwith a parallel length of 75 mm. A mechanical extensometer\nwas used to measure strain along a length of 60 mm. Further-\nmore, another extensometer was used to measure changes in\nthe specimen’s width for a subsequent analysis of the strain\nanisotropy (r-value). The specimens of the rolled sheets were\nfabricated along rolling direction (RD) and transverse direc-\ntion (TD), while the specimens of the extrudates were fabri-\ncated in extrusion direction (ED) only. A minimum of three\nsamples were tested in order to reveal standard deviations of\nmechanical properties.\nThe (cumulative) r-value was calculated using the relation\nr ¼ \u0002\nεpl\nw\nεpl\nl þ εpl\nw\nð1Þ\nwhere εW\nP1 and εW\nP1 are the plastic strains in the width and\nlongitudinal direction. These two plastic strain components\nwere calculated by subtracting the elastic strain from the\nrespective total strain\nεpl\nw ¼ εw þ ν σ\nE ; εpl\nl ¼ εl \u0002 σ\nE\nð2Þ\nwhere εW and ε1 are the true (logarithmic) strains in the width\ndirection and longitudinal direction, σ is true stress, E is Young’s\nmodulus and ν is Poisson’s ratio. For E and ν the values of\n43 GPa and 0.3 were used.

      "text": "Compression Tests\nMethods for large-strain in-plane compression testing of sheet\nmaterials remain challenging as buckling occurs easily\npreventing uniaxial deformation. Therefore, procedures have\nto be developed in order to prevent buckling. This can be\nachieved either by guiding the sheet between rigid blocks\nparallel to the sample or by minimizing the effective length\n(or the length-to-thickness ratio) of the sample. In this work,\nthe two methods are used and the respective results are\ncompared.\nCubic specimens glued with five layers of magnesium\nsheets were prepared for the tests, see Fig. 3(a). The specimens\nwere machined along both, RD and TD. The single sheets\nwere cleaned before applying the J-B-Weld® adhesive\n(see http://www.jbweld.com/ for details). To improve the\nperformance of the adhesive, the surface of the sheet was\nroughened using an abrasive tool mounted on a milling\nmachine. The thickness of the stack was determined by the\nsheets and the adhesive layers and therefore slightly above\n10 mm, the other two sides of the cube were exactly 10 mm.\nThe two surfaces on which the force was applied had been\nmachined to be exactly parallel to each other and perpendicular\nto other faces. The upper and lower platens were mirror\npolished and Teflon spray was used as lubricant between the\nspecimen and the platens to decrease the friction. The testing\nmachine used was a SCHENCK servo-hydraulic 1000 kN\nmachine. A compressive force was applied in the plane of\nthe sheets and the force applied with an initial strain rate of\n0.00016/s was measured by the load cell. The experimental\nsetup is shown in Fig. 4. Like during tensile testing, two sets of\nextensometers were used to measure the displacement in\nloading direction and width direction. The displacement\nbetween the top and bottom surfaces of the specimen was\nrecorded by two extensometers attached to opposite sides\non the platens. The average of their readings was used to\ncalculate the displacement along the compression direction.\nA third extensometer was used to assess the width displace-\nment, see Fig. 4.

To check the repeatability of\nthe results, three experiments were conducted for each\norientation and material respectively.\nMechanical testing in compression generally is not as\nstraight forward as tensile testing. In order to verify the meth-\nod described above, additional tests were conducted using an\nin-plane compression testing apparatus originally designed\nand developed in earlier work [28]. Fig. 5(a) shows the\ncomb-type dies used. The tooth width is 2.7 mm, the tooth\nlength is 55.5 mm, and the gap between the teeth is 3.0 mm.\nDies are installed in the testing apparatus as shown in\nFig. 5(b). Lower die 1 is fixed to the lower plate of the die\nset while lower die 2 is on a slide rail that enables the die to\nmove smoothly in the horizontal direction. A sheet specimen\nis set on lower dies 1 and 2 and both ends of the specimen are\nattached to the dies by chucking plates. Upper dies 1 and 2 are\nplaced on the specimen so that the four positioning pins fixed\nto the lower dies align with the holes of the upper dies.\nAccordingly, the movement of the upper dies is synchronized\nwith that of the lower dies. Lower die 2 is actuated in the\nhorizontal direction by a servo-controlled hydraulic cylinder\nA to apply an in-plane compression force to the specimen.\nHydraulic cylinder B exerts a constant blank-holding force on\nthe specimen through the upper dies and the cylindrical rollers\nlying between the upper dies and the blank-holding platen.\nThe specimens (width 33 mm, parallel length 66 mm, fabri-\ncated by wire EDM [35]) can thus be compressed in the\nlongitudinal direction without buckling. The strains were\nmeasured using a strain gauge (YFLA-2, Tokyo Sokki\nKenkyujo Co., Ltd).\nA blank holding force (BHF) was applied to a specimen\nthrough the upper dies 1 and 2 in order to prevent out-of-plane\nbuckling. The BHF per unit area of the specimen surface was\napproximately 1 % of the yield stress of the sample; therefore,\nthe effect of the BHF on the yielding behavior of the sample\ncan be ignored. In order to prevent the specimen from galling\nthe dies, the specimen was lubricated on both sides with\nVaseline and Teflon sheets (0.05 mm thickness), resulting in\nreduction of the coefficient of friction to 0.02. However, it\nshould be noted that the frictional forces between the dies and\nspecimen have little effect on the measured stress, see [28].\nBiaxial Tests\nConstitutive models of metal plasticity require information on\nother than the uniaxial stress state. Here, experimental data\nwere collected in the biaxial stress states as well. A test setup\nsimilar to the disk compression test [9] and layer compression\ntest [34] was used to obtain a continuous biaxial stress–strain\ncurve for the materials under investigation. Assuming that\nplastic yielding is independent from the hydrostatic pressure,\nthrough-thickness compression of a sheet is equivalent to a\nFig. 4 Setup for uniaxial compression testing using cube specimens\n(mounted in the middle)\nLower die 1\nLower die 2\nUpper die 1\nUpper die 2\nSpecimen\nTeflon sheets\nLoad cell\nHydraulic cylinder A\nBlank holding platen\nHydraulic cylinder B\nLower plate                  Slide rail\nLower die 1    Lower die 2\nUpper die 1                                       Upper die 2\nSpecimen\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 5 Alternative experimental apparatus for application of in-plane compression to a sheet specimen: (a) configuration of the dies, and (b) an overview\nof the testing apparatus\nExp Mech (2014) 54:1247–1258\n1251"

Therefore, biaxial stress\nstates can be investigated by through-thickness compression\nusing a universal testing machine and thus circumventing the\nuse of a hydraulic bulge [46] or a biaxial tester [27].\nFive (six in case of the extruded products) circular samples\nof 20 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness were stacked and\nglued as described in the previous section. The stack of sheets\nwas loaded in compression through upper and lower (mirror-\npolished) platens of a SCHENCK servo-hydraulic 1000 kN\nuniversal testing machine with an initial strain rate of 10−3/s.\nTeflon spray was used as a lubricant between specimen and\nplatens in order to minimize friction. The relative displace-\nment between the platens was recorded using two MTS ex-\ntensometers. The biaxial stress, σb, and the thickness strain, εt,\nwere calculated from the averaged extensometer signal u and\nthe compressive force F of the load cell following\nσb ¼ 4F\nπd0\n2\n1−u\nt0\n\u0001\n\u0003\n; εt ¼ ln 1−u\nt0\n\u0001\n\u0003\n; u≥0\nð3Þ\nwith t0 being the initial thickness of the stack and d0 its initial\ndiameter. In this case, isochoric deformation was considered.\nIn contrast to the interrupted test on single disks proposed\nearlier, this setup yields a continuous force-displacement sig-\nnal from which a stress-strain curve can be calculated assum-\ning isochoric deformation. It is worth to mention that the\nbiaxial stress, σb, is realised via a compressive force in thick-\nness direction – not via in-plane tension loading. This implies\nthat the common understanding of true stresses being larger\nthan engineering stresses appears reversed. Furthermore, the\nextraction of only one stress and one strain component\ndrops the information on the evolution of anisotropic\ndeformation. Hence it cannot be expected that this test-\nsetup reveals information on the heterogeneity of the strain\nresponse directly. Any attempt towards parameter identifi-\ncation for plasticity models should consider the scalar\ncharacter of the stress signal obtained hereby.\nResults\nTension Tests\nFlow curves of the materials under investigation relating true\nstresses and (accumulated) r-values with the true (logarithmic)\nstrains of AZ31 and ZE10 tested in the two selected loading\ndirections (RD and TD) are shown in Fig. 6. In case of the r-\nvalue, the respective curves represent averaged values obtain-\ned from different tests. Both sheets exhibit in-plane anisotropy\nin the yield stress, which was also observed in earlier work\n[44]. The flow curves obtained for the alloy ZE10 show higher\nyield stresses in the RD than in the TD. In the opposite, similar\ntests on AZ31 reveal higher yield stresses along the TD.\nBetween the two alloys, AZ31 generally shows a higher stress\nlevel for both variants, rolled and extruded products.\nIn case of the sheets taken from the extruded profiles only\ntensile tests along the ED were carried out. Both materials\nexhibit the typical convex curve like it was also found in the\ntests of the rolled sheets. One difference is that the fracture\nstrains of extruded sheets are lower than that of rolled material,\nsee also Table 1. The ductility of ZE10 in the TD is much\nhigher compared to the RD and the failure strain reaches to\n35 %.\nThe r-value was determined from the specimen’s width\nchange up to the maximum force. What should be noticed is\nthat the r-value of AZ31 rolled sheets is significantly higher\nthan that of ZE10 rolled sheets. The respective differences in\nr-value between the RD and the TD are also remarkable.\nWhile the r-value of AZ31 rolled sheets reaches 7.1 at\nmaximum load, its respective counterpart in case of ZE10\nrolled sheets is 0.76. A dissimilarity to rolled material is\nthat the r-value of ZE10 extruded material is generally\nlarger than that of AZ31.\nCompression Tests\nIn order to validate the compression testing method using\nglued cube samples described above, the results obtained for\nAZ31 rolled sheet material by this method are compared with\ndata acquired using a comb-shaped die and a single sheet. The\nengineering stress strain curves of the three samples oriented\nin RD using cube specimens are plotted together with the\nresult using flat specimens, see Fig. 7. The respective sets of\ncurves differ in the early stage of deformation, in which elastic\ndeformation is dominant. While the displacement signal cal-\nculated from the comb-shaped die is based on strain gauges\nand therefore can be regarded as being exact, the displacement\nsignal from the cube tests is influenced by “seating” of the\nsample. Consequently, the elastic slope (indicated in Fig. 7) is\nnot met. This can be compensated once the plastic response is\ncalculated by subtracting a “pseudo-elastic strain” from the\nrecorded strain. In this case the differences between the two\nuniaxial compression tests are acceptable. The cube tests\nfurthermore show a very good reproducibility.\nFigure 8 illustrates the stress-strain curves of AZ31 and\nZE10 during uniaxial in-plane compression tests. The results\nobtained are presented in terms of direction dependent flow\ncurves and r-values. Averaged responses were calculated from\nall tests (three minimum) performed per orientation. Statistical\ninformation is included in Table 1.\nThe anisotropic behavior follows the same way with that of\nthe tensile test. The in-plane anisotropy can be observed. In\ncase of AZ31, the yield stress in TD is higher. In contrast, the\nyield stress in RD is higher for ZE10. Differences between\nrolled and extruded material are not pronounced. Failure of the\nsamples happened slightly earlier in case of the extruded\n1252\nExp Mech (2014) 54:1247–1258"

It\nshould be noted here that the extruded product showed a\ntendency to buckle before failure, but the rolled sheets did\nnot. Compared to the plane rolled products, the extruded\npanels were slightly warped, fostering plastic instability.\nAn interesting feature of the compression tests is the evo-\nlution of the r-value during deformation. Different to the\nfrequently reported evolution in tension, the r-values in com-\npression are very low – the respective values are generally\nbelow 0.2. Only in case of ZE10 rolled sheet (RD) it reaches a\nmaximum value of 0.4 prior to failure. The negative values\ncorrespond to a thickening of the samples due to extensive\ntwinning activity.

Five “coins” of 10 mm diameter were glued to stacks of\n5 mm height, maintaining the aspect ratio of the specimens\ndescribed in the previous section. The results of two compres-\nsion experiments are shown in Fig. 9 together with results\nobtained from alternative testing methods in terms of biaxial\nstress (or membrane stress in case of the bulge test) σb as a\nfunction of the plastic thickness strain, εpl\nt. The latter was\ncomputed for the test of the cruciform specimen from the\nmeasured strain components along the axes of orthotropy\nassuming isochoric plastic deformation. All tests revealed\nsimilar characteristics. While the signal obtained from the\nbulge test is subjected to scatter, the equi-biaxial tensile exper-\niments and the stacked disk compression tests show a smooth\nsignal. Due to the anisotropy of the material, the cruciform\nspecimen reveals independent (and not equal) signals for the\ntwo stress components – see insert in Fig. 9. The signal derived\nfrom the stacked disks yield almost identical result up to a total\nstrain of 0.011. This is surprising, as the latter may suffer from\nfriction effects while the first does not. While the biaxial\ntension test was stopped once the arms of the cruciform spec-\nimen torn off [4], the stacked-coin compression test yields still\nvalid results up to a plastic strain of 0.05. Then the specimens\nfailed by a shear fracture through their thickness, see Fig. 3(d).\nDue to the good agreement of the tests with respect to the\nbiaxial stress–strain curve, it seems that the compression test\ndescribed here can be used to generate valid biaxial stress\nstrain characteristics without further correction for friction.\nFigure 6 summarizes the biaxial stress-strain curves obtained\nfor the materials, ZE10 and AZ31, rolled sheets and extruded\nproducts. Note that in this case the thickness strain is used as the\nindependent variable. For all materials, the curves are not\nparallel to those obtained by uniaxial tension. This evidences\nthe distortional character of hardening [33]. For AZ31 a high\nhardening rate is recorded.

      "text": "thickness strain of 0.3, which is approximately the same than\nthe fracture strain observed in uniaxial tension along RD. The\nrespective sample showed strong anisotropic deformation, lead-\ning to an oval shape of the initially circular coin stack. This is\nexpected, because equal stresses imposed along the RD and the\nTD direction only result in identical principal strains once the\nbiaxial r-value of the material equals unity [6]. Hence, any\nellipticity of the stack observed after compression evidences a\nbiaxial r-value different from unity.\nDiscussion\nThe tensile behavior of the two sheets and extrusions can be\nexplained if grain size and texture effects on the activity of\nstrain accommodating deformation mechanisms are consid-\nered. It has been noted that basal slip and tension twinning, i.e.\ntwins that allow strain accommodation due to c-axis exten-\nsion, play a major role for the resulting strength properties.\nA decrease in grain size, measured e.g. as the average grain\nsize of a sample, leads to an increase in yield stress correlated\nwith the boundary strengthening mechanism as described by\nHall and Petch. For magnesium extrusions it was shown that\nboth, glide mechanisms and twinning, follow a typical linear\nbehavior of increasing yield strength with the inverse square\nroot of the average grain size [11, 13].\nTexture effects with a specific impact on basal slip are\nrelated to the activation ability described by Schmid’s law.\nThus, a strong alignment of basal planes into testing direction\nwill limit the ability of this deformation mechanism to con-\ntribute to strain accommodation and will result in higher\nstresses before activation. Therefore a line can be drawn\nbetween the ability to activate this mechanism and the mac-\nroscopic yield stress if dislocation glide rather than twinning is\nthe dominating deformation mechanism.\nIf the texture is first considered, the angular distribution of\nbasal planes of the AZ31 sheet between the normal direction\n(ND) and the rolling direction (RD) is broader compared to\nthe one between the ND and the transverse direction (TD).\nThis favors the activation of basal slip if stress is uniaxially\napplied along the RD rather than along the TD. This imposes a\nmechanical anisotropy with higher tensile yield stress (TYS)\nin the TD than in the RD. In case of the ZE10 sheet it is vice\nversa because of the broader angular distribution of basal\nplanes towards TD. Furthermore, the texture results in a less\nsignificant alignment of basal planes in any orientation, spe-\ncifically in the sheet plane. Thus, an unfavorable orientation to\nactivate basal slip parallel to the sheet plane is not distinct\nanymore which therefore leads to reduced TYS in both orien-\ntations compared to AZ31. In case of compression tests the\nstrong alignment of basal planes in case of the AZ31 sheet\nfavors twinning in compression in both orientations, especial-\nly if compared to the ZE10 sheet. Thus, the texture of the\nZE10 sheet does not exhibit a preferential orientation distri-\nbution which favours twinning in compression in the sheet\nplane. This results in higher compressive yield stress (CYS) in\ncase of ZE10 because twinning cannot take the significant role\nas it does in case of the AZ31 sheet. The resulting SD effect is\nconsequently less significant in the ZE10 sheet, compare\nFigs. 6 and 8 or see Table 1. Furthermore, it is less significant\nin the TD rather than in the RD which is also related to the\nspecific orientation distribution of basal planes.\nIn case of the ZE10 extrusion a strong texture with broad\nangular distribution towards the TD can be correlated to a\nlarger difference between TYS and CYS and therefore with a\nhigh strength differential (SD), see Table 1. The CYS again is\nexpected to be lower in the TD, which is confirmed by the\nexperiments, see Fig. 8(d). In case of the AZ31 extrusion only\na smaller angular spread of basal planes is revealed and the\ndifference in the CYS in RD and TD is significantly lower.\nFurthermore this is the only sample of this study showing a\nsmaller average grain size. That may explain the resulting\nhigher CYS in both orientations whereas for the TYS in RD\nno clear difference is revealed compared to the AZ31 sheet.\nComparing the flow curves in compression with that in\ntension, the stress differential effect (SD effect) is manifested.\nThe flow curves under compressive loading have concave\nshape with increasing stress.

      "text": "sheets, see Fig. 10. The first stage reflects the elastic-plastic\ntransition. In the second stage of progressive hardening both\nmaterials follow the same characteristic. In stage 3, all AZ31\nmaterials as well as the extruded ZE10 material feature a\nstrong increase in hardening. Different from that, ZE10 rolled\nmaterial follows a trend similar to that of stage 2. Finally, in\nstage four work hardening is saturating, approaching a hori-\nzontal slope prior to failure. Except for ZE10 rolled sheets, all\nmaterials investigated show a pronounced progressive work\nhardening characteristic. This might be beneficial for some\nstructural applications.\nWhile the differences in the mechanical responses of uniaxial\ntension and compression can easily be explained on the basis of\nthe propensity to activate basal slip and twinning, the prismatic\nslip is to be considered as an important deformation mechanism\nto fulfil the requirements for polycrystalline plastic deformation\n[1]. Specifically, it has been shown in case of biaxial testing that\nthe abnormal hardening is caused by the delayed activation of\nprismatic slip under equi-biaxial stresses acting perpendicular to\nthe basal plane [19]. As all tested products show a (more the less\npronounced) basal texture, this effect is present in rolled and\nextruded products of both alloys. The absence of prismatic slip\ncauses an early failure of the material by shear separation on\ninclined planes [38]. It is worth to mention that this type of\nbiaxial hardening cannot be described by a plasticity law based\non the von Mises yield criterion. A model accounting for\ndifferential hardening is required instead.\nThe presented experiments yield a non-constant r-value in\ncompression in the range of 0.2–0.4. They are significantly\nlower that the respective r-values in tension. If ND is the\n“thickness-direction” of the sheet and extruded product, re-\nspectively, the material flow is favored in ND rather than in the\nother non-compressed direction. Thus the thickness strain, εt,\nis significantly larger than the width strain of the compressed\nsample, εw. The reason for this behaviour lies in the twinning\nactivity, which is pronounced in the RD and TD compression\nregime, but not in tension. Extension twinning causes a re-\norientation of the basal plane by 86.3° [43] in a part of the grain\nand therefore strongly influences the global deformation mode.\nThis effect has also been shown experimentally for AR31B,\nsee [30] as well as numerically by using the visco-plastic self-\nconsistent scheme for the same material, see [41].\nMagnesium alloys generally show a rate dependent me-\nchanical behaviour, in particular at elevated temperatures.\nVariations in the yield strength with strain rate where different\ndeformation mechanisms are active were observed [32]. All\ntests reported here were conducted with an initial strain rate\nbeing less or equal 10−3 s−1. For the temperature and these\nloading rates the rate effects appear negligible, see also tests\nreported elsewhere, e.g. [33].\nFor the calibration of yield surfaces the instantaneous r-\nvalue is commonly preferred, see [30] for a good example.\nOnce the normality rule is used for computing the strain\nincrements from the plastic potential, the ratio\nr0 ¼ ˙ε pl\nw\n˙ε pl\nt\nð4Þ\ngives the normal to the yield surface. Hence, the dependency\nof plastic width and thickness strain was fitted by cubic\nfunctions; their first derivatives are shown as instantaneous\nr-values r´ in Fig. 11. The cumulative and instantaneous r-\nvalues do not coincide, because the planar anisotropy of the\nmaterials is evolving. Typically, the instantaneous r-values are\nhigher compared to their cumulative counterparts. This has\nbeen reported already for the case of tensile loads [30] and\ncould be confirmed in the present study. The same trend is\nobserved in case of compressive loads, however, the differ-\nence between instantaneous and cumulative r-value appears\nmore pronounced, compare Fig. 6 and the respective figure in\n[30]. This effect is related to the progressive increase of the r-\nvalue with strain in case of compression and hence has to be\nconsidered in parameter identification procedures.\nBoth, in Figs. 6 and 8, only the inelastic portion of the total\nstrains is considered, see Equation (2). It is assumed that –\nindependently of the magnitude of strain – unloading would\nbe purely elastic and follow the initial Young’s modulus. This\nmight not be the case, as previous investigation reveal a\ndecrease of the elastic slope after pre-straining the material\nin tension [5]. A quantification of the recoverable inelastic\nstrain, as conducted in [16] for steel and aluminium, was not\nperformed here. In an attempt to quantify the effect of\nchanging E-modulus, two additional curves are included in\nFig. 11(a): One representing the accumulated r-value assuming\na decrease of the initial Young’s modulus by 15 %, another by\nneglecting the elastic strain in Equation (1). From this figure it\nbecomes obvious that in both cases the calculated r-value is\ninside the confidence band established by repeated tests, see\n0,00\n0,02\n0,04\n0,06\n0,08\n0,10\n0,12\n0,14\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\nIV\nIII\nII\nd /d  [MPa]\nplastic strain\n AZ31 RD\n AZ31 TD\n AZ31 ED\n ZE10 RD\n ZE10 TD\n ZE10 ED\nI\nFig. 10 Rate of hardening during compression for AZ31 and ZE10 rolled\nsheets and extruded profile along RD and TD (sheet) and ED (extrudates)\n1256\nExp Mech (2014) 54:1247–1258"

Hence, disregarding the elastic strains does not signifi-\ncantly change the results.\nConclusions\nA relatively simple method to determine the compressive\nbehaviour of sheet metal was used to quantify the mechanical\nbehaviour of two magnesium alloys, AZ31 and ZE10, pro-\nduced by two different production routes. The method uses\ntwo independent extensometers to simultaneously record lon-\ngitudinal and transversal strains and therefore determines r-\nvalues during compression parallel to the sheet planes. The\nmethod was successfully validated via a more sophisticated\nsetup based on comb dies. Restrictions apply only in the early\nstage of deformation, as the elastic slope could not be recov-\nered due to seating of the specimen.\nA very similar setup was used to assess the equi-biaxial\n(tensile) behaviour of the materials. This method was\nvalidated against hydraulic bulge and cruciform specimen\ntests and found to give good results. The method can be used to\nachieve higher strains before failure, because plastic instabilities\nare suppressed compared to the aforementioned test methods.\nMechanical tests were conducted along the orthotropic\naxes of the materials. The measured behaviour was explained\nby differences in the microstructure and texture. Certain trends\ncould be explained through the fundamental deformation\nmechanisms present in magnesium alloys. An evolving\nstrength differential effect in both flow stress and r-value\nresponse of all materials was observed. The compressive r-\nvalues are generally lower than the tensile r-values. The\ngenerated results are comprehensive enough to be used as an\ninput for constitutive modeling.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors appreciate the help of Dr.-Ing.
